                  Imagine an international gateway where goods and merchandise
                  flow across borders. Where countries lower taxes, reduce red
                  tape, and eliminate road blocks. Where companies import goods
                  and merchandise directly into a Free Trade Zone - and then
                  ship products out duty free.</p>

                  The Miami Free Trade Zone connects North America, Europe and
                  Asia to Latin America and the Caribbean via direct air and sea
                  transportation links, plus rail and expressway. Operated by
                  FTZ World Services, the 47-acre Zone (#372) saves companies
                  money and time.
